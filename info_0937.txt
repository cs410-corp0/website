Work Experience

Team Heatmap:
Role: programmer.
- Completed a preliminary task consisting of setting up the development environment
and writing a short test program to verify that the necessary libraries were installed
properly. I installed the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) locally, and used the library to
write a program estimating the value of Pi using random numbers.
- Implemented a Python frontend for visualization and a C++ backend for pseudo-random
number generation.
- Source code: https://github.com/UMB-Heatmap/pi-est 

Celtic Knot Team 9:
- Wrote the HTML code for part I of the celtic knot, which my team then assembled into
the segment we were assigned.
